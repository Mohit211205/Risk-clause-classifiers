OVERVIEW OF THE DEFERRED VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT
The following provides an overview of the Deferred Variable Annuity Contract’s primary features",Warranty,0.429,2
196,"Please
read the full descriptions in the rest of this Summary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and your Contract, for more
information regarding these features and other provisions of the Contract",Governing Law,0.457,1
197,"Purpose of the Contract
The Contract is designed to accumulate Contract Value and to provide income over a certain period of time
or for life subject to certain conditions",Indemnification,0.491,3
198,"The Contract can supplement your retirement income by providing a stream of
income payments during the Annuity Payout Period",Termination,0.279,3
199,"The benefits offered under the Contract may be a variable or fixed
amount, if available, or a combination of both",Termination,0.389,3
200,"The Contract also offers a death benefit payable to your designated
Beneficiaries upon the death of the Contract Owner or Annuitant",Indemnification,0.729,3
201,This Contract may be appropriate if you have a long investment time horizon,Warranty,0.484,2
202,"It is not intended for people
who may need to make early or frequent withdrawals or intend to engage in frequent trading in the Variable Investment
Options",Warranty,0.355,2
203,"Phases of the Contract
Your Contract has two phases: (1) an accumulation (savings) phase called the Accumulation Period, prior to
the Annuity Date; and (2) a payout (income) phase called the Annuity Payout Period, after the Annuity Date",Termination,0.278,3
204,"Accumulation (Savings) Period
To help you accumulate assets during the Accumulation Period, you can invest your payments and earnings
in different Investment Options as follows:
 
 
•
  The Contract allows you to allocate your Contract Value among the different Variable Investment
Options which each invest in a specified mutual fund portfolio (each, a “Portfolio”)",Warranty,0.654,2
205,"Your Contract
Value will increase or decrease to reflect the investment performance of the Portfolios you select;
you bear the investment risk and you can lose money invested in the Portfolios",Warranty,0.552,2
206,"Appendix A to this
Summary Prospectus lists the Portfolios currently available in the Contract and includes
additional information about the Portfolios",Warranty,0.37,2
207,"•
  In addition to the Variable Investment Options, the Contract allows you to allocate your Contract
Value to the Fixed Account Options",Warranty,0.863,2
208,"The Fixed Account Options are the Short-Term Fixed Account
and the Fixed Dollar Cost Averaging Options",Warranty,0.681,2
209,"The optional benefits do not permit you to invest in the
Short-Term Fixed Account",Warranty,0.467,2
210,"The Fixed Account Options are designed to be safe investments that
provide fixed returns, where the Company pays a fixed rate of interest (that it declares periodically,
subject to a minimum) and where the Company bears the investment risk",Warranty,0.706,2
211,"The Fixed Account
Options are described in Appendix B to the Prospectus",Warranty,0.538,2
212,"•
  You can change the Investment Options in which you invest throughout the Accumulation Period",Warranty,0.51,2
213,"Annuity (Income) Payout Period
You can elect to annuitize your Contract and turn your Contract Value into a stream of income payments
(called annuity payments), at which time the Accumulation Period of the Contract ends",Warranty,0.4,2
214,"These payments may continue
for a fixed period of years, for your entire life, or for the longer of a fixed period or your life",Termination,0.299,3
215,"If you annuitize, your
investments will be converted to income payments and you may no longer be able to choose to make withdrawals from
your Contract (depending on which Annuity option you select)",Warranty,0.536,2
216,"All benefits (including death benefits and optional
benefits) terminate upon Annuitization",Intellectual Property,0.263,2
217,"However, several optional benefit Riders offered under the Contract provide guaranteed payments during
the accumulation phase that may last for life, and still allow you to make withdrawals and be eligible for a death benefit",Warranty,0.371,2
218,"Withdrawals that exceed specified limits under an optional benefit will reduce and could eliminate the income payments
and other benefits of the optional benefit, including access to a death benefit",Warranty,0.267,2
219,"Contract Features
Base Contract
The Contract has a seven year Surrender Charge Period (based on each Purchase Payment) and a
Contract expense charge of 1",Termination,0.403,3
220,40 of the Variable Investment Options on an annual basis,Intellectual Property,0.463,2
221,"Transfers
Within limitations, you may transfer Contract Value from one Variable Investment Option to another and
between the Short-Term Fixed Account and the Variable Investment Options",Warranty,0.82,2
222,"In addition, the Contract offers two
automated transfer programs — a dollar cost averaging program and an asset rebalancing program",Warranty,0.681,2
223,"You can elect to
have your account value automatically rebalanced at no additional charge",Warranty,0.881,2
224,"We offer rebalancing programs that you can
use to automatically reallocate your account value among your Variable Investment Options",Warranty,0.951,2
225,"You can also elect to
allocate your investments using a dollar cost averaging program at no additional charge",Warranty,0.542,2
226,"You may not elect both a
dollar cost averaging program and a rebalancing program",Confidentiality,0.323,1
227,"Contract Value
The Contract Value includes the amount in the Variable Investment Options and the Fixed Account Options",Warranty,0.619,2
228,"The value of your Contract will increase or decrease based upon the investment performance of the Variable
Investment Options you choose, your Purchase Payments, interest credited to the Fixed Account Options, any partial
withdrawals, and the charges we deduct",Warranty,0.724,2
229,"Surrenders and Withdrawals
During the Accumulation Period you can surrender the Contract or withdraw part of the Contract Value",Warranty,0.478,2
230,"However, the Contract is generally not a liquid investment",Warranty,0.249,2
231,"If you withdraw early, a Surrender Charge and federal and
state taxes may apply and/or you may incur a tax penalty if you are younger than 59 1⁄2",Termination,0.288,3
232,"Withdrawals, including
Required Minimum Distributions (“RMDs”), could significantly reduce the standard death benefit in addition to the
guaranteed benefits, and the amount of the reduction may be greater than the dollar amount of the withdrawal and
could terminate the guaranteed benefits",Warranty,0.285,2
233,"Free Look Period: “Right to Cancel”
If you are a new purchaser of a Contract, you may cancel your Contract within 10 days of receiving it without
paying fees or penalties",Termination,0.42,3
234,"In some states, this “Free Look” or cancellation period may be longer",Termination,0.411,3
235,"If you cancel your
Contract, in most states you will receive your Contract value and any fees or charges deducted",Termination,0.344,3
236,"In some states, you
will receive a full refund of the amount of any Purchase Payments you have paid, if greater than Contract value",Warranty,0.389,2
237,"To
cancel your Contract, simply deliver or mail the Contract to our office or to the financial professional who delivered the
Contract to you",Indemnification,0.561,3
238,"Death Benefit
Your Contract includes a death benefit that will be paid upon the death of either the Contract Owner or the
Annuitant",Indemnification,0.56,3
239,"On the death of the Annuitant, the death benefit will be equal to the greater of Contract Value or Purchase
Payments less adjusted withdrawals",Indemnification,0.478,3
240,"On the death of the Contract Owner who is not the Annuitant, the death benefit
will be equal to the Contract Value",Indemnification,0.597,3
241,"Optional Benefit Riders
You may purchase certain available optional benefits for an additional fee:
 
 
•
  Enhanced Death Benefit Rider – offers a Death Benefit Enhancement;
 
 
•
  Accumulation Income Rider — provides for guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawals under the terms of the
Rider;
 
 
•
  Guaranteed Income Rider — provides for living benefit Withdrawals under the terms of the Rider;
and
 
 
•
  Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Rider — provides for a return of a minimum value at the end of
the Accumulation Benefit Period",Warranty,0.38,2
242,"13
These optional benefit Riders provide different methods to take income from your Contract Value or receive
lifetime payments and provide certain guarantees, regardless of the investment performance of the Contract",Warranty,0.397,2
243,"These
guarantees are subject to certain conditions, as set forth elsewhere in this Summary Prospectus and the Prospectus",Governing Law,0.447,1
244,"Withdrawals that exceed specified limitations under certain Riders may result in a reduction or premature
termination of those benefits or of those Riders",Confidentiality,0.289,1
245,"Withdrawals under the Riders, including Guaranteed Annual
Withdrawal Amounts, are subject to the surrender charge rules",Warranty,0.429,2
246,"Therefore, a surrender charge may apply to such
withdrawals",Indemnification,0.474,3
247,"Withdrawals, including RMDs, could significantly reduce the values under the Riders, perhaps by more than
the amount of the withdrawal, and could terminate the Riders and the Contract",Termination,0.446,3
248,"The Guaranteed Income Rider and Accumulation Income Rider provide a contingent guarantee that may never
come into effect because withdrawals taken while Contract Value is greater than zero are withdrawals of the Contract
Owner’s own money, and the Company is only required to make guaranteed payments from its general account if and
when the Contract Value is reduced to zero",Warranty,0.311,2
249,"The Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Rider provides a guarantee that may never come into effect because
Contract Value may never be less than the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit Amount, and the possibility that
the Company will be required to pay the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit Amount may be minimal",Warranty,0.461,2
250,"While the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Rider provides a guarantee that is designed to provide a minimum
Contract Value, additional Purchase Payments made after the first 12 months of the Accumulation Benefit Period will
not be included in the Accumulation Benefit Base",Warranty,0.558,2
251,"Any additional Purchase Payments made after the first 12 months
will increase the Contract Value but not the Accumulation Benefit Base and may reduce the likelihood of receiving the
benefit provided by the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Rider",Warranty,0.395,2
252,"Subsequent Purchase Payments are not permitted during the Withdrawal Phase of the Accumulation Income
Rider, which means that the Purchase Payments cannot be used at that time to increase Contract Value, the death
benefit or the Accumulation Income Benefit Base",Termination,0.335,3
253,"If you select an optional benefit Rider, you are not permitted to invest in the Short-Term Fixed Account",Warranty,0.362,2
254,"In the
future we may change this restriction or add new ones relating to other Investment Options",Warranty,0.275,2
255,"Taxes
You can transfer money between Investment Options without tax implications, and earnings (if any) on your
investments are generally tax-deferred",Warranty,0.272,2
256,"You are taxed only: (1) when you make a surrender or withdrawal; (2) when
you receive an income payment from the Contract; or (3) upon payment of a death benefit",Indemnification,0.355,3
257,"That means Contract
Owners enjoy tax-deferred growth, which provides greater earnings potential as compared to a fully taxable
investment",Confidentiality,0.25,1
